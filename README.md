# Schedule-9-to-5

## Description

In this assignment, I was trying to display the functionality and convenience of allowing the user to go from the pad-and-pen approach to a day planner in favor of electronic scheduling.

The purpose was to show the user a more real-time ability in tracking the day's goals by using a color-coded system to describe events that are currently being noted as well as events for also the past and the future. These events in real-time were determined by compared the current time to a military time standard in the interest of facilitating a simpler ascending order scheme for time.

The color-coding was as follows:

Gray: "past" events,

Red: "present" events,

Green: "future" events.

Finally, entries which are saved in the planner are stored in localStorage and can only be deleted via access to the DevTools "Application" settings. This is available upon selecting the "Inspect" option, which can be reached when right-clicking.

What I have learned from this exercise is that there are quite a few steps to be used when trying to extract data values assigned to individual ID's in order to form a numerical array.  Weaving jQuery into JavaScript code can be difficult due to questions of compatibility; however, the end result proved quite satisfying. Manipulating the CSS header element allowed me to keep the current date in my viewport when manipulating its CSS element became troublesome. 

Overall, I was able to work with HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, and dayjs in my code.

## Installation

Modified index.html and style.css files in VS Code and included requisite comments.

Added all modified and untracked files in the entire repository using git.

Finally pushed all finished work to GitHub.

GitPages supplied deployed changes to launch refactored website.

## Usage

The end user should be able to traverse the day planner website, which has the current date in its header, from the typical 9am through 5pm work week schedule. The user will be able to click on a text box within each corresponding hour block and be able to input their information. Once complete, they should be able to click on the save button, which has an icon of an old 3.5" floppy disk located on a button to the right of the text box. The information will be affixed to the time block regardless of webpage refresh.
